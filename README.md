# EZ TODO

A simple and efficient web application for managing daily tasks. This app allows users to add new tasks with due dates, mark them as completed, and delete them when they are no longer needed.

## Functionality

- **Add Tasks:** Users can input a task name and a due date via a popup modal.
- **Validation:** The form prevents users from submitting empty or invalid data.
- **Task Management:**
  - **Check:** Mark a task as complete by clicking the checkbox.
  - **Delete:** Remove a task permanently by clicking the trash icon.
- **Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies

- **HTML5** & **CSS3** (with Flexbox/Grid)
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Code is organized into `Todo` and `FormValidator` classes.
- **ES Modules:** Code is split into separate files for better maintainability.
- **BEM Methodology:** For clean and organized CSS class naming.
